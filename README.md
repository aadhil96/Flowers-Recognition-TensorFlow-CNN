# Flowers-Recognition-TensorFlow-CNN
  In this dataset we are mainly focusing towards how we can build a dataframe from folders of images and classify them with deep neural nets.
  
#### Data Source : ![Link](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)
- This dataset contains 4242 images of flowers.
- The data collection is based on the data flicr, google images, yandex images.
